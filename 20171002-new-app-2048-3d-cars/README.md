2048 3D Cars! is a fun and easy to play puzzle game. It’s like the 2048 game, but with cars!
 
This game was created because 2048 is awesome, but numbers are a little boring.
 
* Swipe to move the cars parts and assemble them to create new cars.
* There are multiple levels and cars. Unlock them all…
